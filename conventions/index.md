# Conventions

## How to use this guide

This guide represents the latest state of designs or in-product workflows. It is meant to be used as a source by anyone designing within the Application Services ecosystem, with the intention of creating a consistent experience. This documentation is meant to provide insight into the current conventions used in the product and, where applicable, document upcoming conventions (that have been agreed on by product and design stakeholders). This guide also aims to show examples to give context for designing similar pages or workflows.

Application Services products use PatternFly as a pattern library and this guide does not replace PatternFly in any way â€“ it builds upon PatternFly in the specific context of Application Services. These conventions show how PatternFly components are combined to create Application Services specific experiences. Currently, products within Application Services are using PatternFly 4.

Application Services designs for individual workflows or new patterns are hosted and approved on this repository:
